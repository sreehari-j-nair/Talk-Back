Title: Speech Repetition Program (Python)

Description:
This is a speech repetition program implemented in Python that utilizes the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech synthesis and the speech_recognition library for speech recognition. The program allows users to interact with their computer by speaking, and the computer will repeat their input back to them using synthesized speech.

Features:

Speech Recognition: The program uses the speech_recognition library to capture and transcribe spoken words into text. It listens for user input through the microphone and converts it into a textual format.
Text-to-Speech Synthesis: The program utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert the captured text into speech. It synthesizes the text and plays it back to the user using the computer's speakers.
Real-Time Repetition: The program immediately repeats the user's spoken words back to them, creating a "Talking Tom" like experience. The user can hear their own words echoed back, making the interaction more engaging and interactive.

Usage:
To use the speech repetition program, simply run the Python script. Once the program is running, speak into the microphone, and your words will be echoed back to you using synthesized speech. Speak "sleep" to your microphone inorder to end the program.

Dependencies:
The program relies on the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech synthesis and the speech_recognition library for speech recognition. Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the program.
